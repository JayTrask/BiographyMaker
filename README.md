# BiographyMaker
My intention for this project is to create a program that allows users to input information which will then be output to a text file containing a complete biography for DnD and forum style roleplaying games.

For now the focus is to learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The large majority of my focus so far are the behaviors of lists and tables in HTML/CSS.
